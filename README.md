## 👹 The Surveillance Giants

### Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp)
Meta has doubled down on surveillance-driven advertising and cross-platform profiling.
* 🤖 **AI Training:** Your posts and photos are used to train proprietary models.
* 💰 **"Pay or OK":** Putting a price tag on fundamental privacy rights.
* 🔗 **Cross-App Linking:** Tracking your behavior even when you aren't using their apps.

### Google (Search, Chrome, Gmail, Android)
Google builds "digital twins" of its users by tracking every search, location, and email.
* 🌐 **Fingerprinting:** Advanced methods to track you even without cookies.
* 📍 **Location History:** A permanent record of your physical movements.

### TikTok & Snapchat
* 📱 **TikTok:** Collects biometric data, keystroke patterns, and clipboard content.
* 👻 **Snapchat:** Constant GPS tracking via Snap Map and extensive metadata collection.

### 🧩 Essential Browser Extensions (Firefox)
To maximize your protection, install these on desktop:
* [**uBlock Origin**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) – The gold standard for ad and tracker blocking.
* [**NoScript**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/) – Prevents malicious scripts from running.
* [**LocalCDN**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/localcdn-fork-of-decentraleyes/) – Protects against tracking via Content Delivery Networks.

🔧 Hardening Firefox (Quick Setup)
Stop the leaks by adjusting these built-in settings. Open Firefox and go to Settings:

1. 🛡️ Set Tracking Protection to "Strict"
Go to Privacy & Security → Enhanced Tracking Protection.

Select Strict.

Why? This blocks social media trackers, fingerprinters, and cross-site cookies more aggressively than the default.

2. 🔒 Enable HTTPS-Only Mode
Scroll down to Security in the Privacy & Security panel.

Select Enable HTTPS-Only Mode in all windows.

Why? This ensures your connection is always encrypted. If a site doesn't support it, Firefox will warn you before connecting.


3. 🔍 Switch to DuckDuckGo
Go to Search in the left sidebar.

Under Default Search Engine, select DuckDuckGo.

Pro Tip: Uncheck "Show search suggestions" to prevent your keystrokes from being sent to the search engine in real-time.

🚫 4. Disable Telemetry (Data Collection)
Go to Privacy & Security → Firefox Data Collection and Use.

Uncheck all boxes (Technical data, Backlogged crash reports, etc.).

Why? Even "anonymous" data can be used to profile your device.

### ⚖️ A Note on DuckDuckGo
While we recommend DuckDuckGo over Google, no service is perfect. According to [ToS;DR](https://tosdr.org/en/service/220):
* ⚠️ **Implicit Consent:** They assume you agree to their terms just by using the site.
* ⚠️ **Term Changes:** They may update their privacy policy without emailing you first.
* ✅ **Anonymity:** No registration is required, and they provide a [Tor Onion Service](https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sja7o78xcotqf65c666m6ha6p26766id.onion/) for maximum privacy.

**Alternative:** If you want even more control, try [SearXNG](https://searxng.org/) (a meta-search engine you can self-host).
