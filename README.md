## 👹 The Surveillance Giants

### Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp)
Meta has doubled down on surveillance-driven advertising and cross-platform profiling.
* 🤖 **AI Training:** Your posts and photos are used to train proprietary models.
* 💰 **"Pay or OK":** Putting a price tag on fundamental privacy rights.
* 🔗 **Cross-App Linking:** Tracking your behavior even when you aren't using their apps.

### Google (Search, Chrome, Gmail, Android)
Google builds "digital twins" of its users by tracking every search, location, and email.
* 🌐 **Fingerprinting:** Advanced methods to track you even without cookies.
* 📍 **Location History:** A permanent record of your physical movements.

### TikTok & Snapchat
* 📱 **TikTok:** Collects biometric data, keystroke patterns, and clipboard content.
* 👻 **Snapchat:** Constant GPS tracking via Snap Map and extensive metadata collection.

## 🔧 Hardening Firefox (Quick Setup)
*Stop the leaks by adjusting these built-in settings. Open Firefox and go to **Settings**:*

### 🛡️ 1. Set Tracking Protection to "Strict"
1. Navigate to **Privacy & Security**.
2. Under **Enhanced Tracking Protection**, select **Strict**.
> **Why?** This blocks social media trackers, fingerprinters, and cross-site cookies more aggressively than the default mode.

### 🔒 2. Enable HTTPS-Only Mode
1. Stay in **Privacy & Security** and scroll down to **Security**.
2. Select **Enable HTTPS-Only Mode in all windows**.
> **Why?** This ensures your connection is always encrypted. Firefox will warn you before connecting to an insecure (HTTP) site.

### 🔍 3. Switch to DuckDuckGo
1. Go to **Search** in the left sidebar.
2. Under **Default Search Engine**, select **DuckDuckGo**.
3. **Pro Tip:** Uncheck *"Show search suggestions"* to stop your keystrokes from being sent to the server in real-time.

### 🚫 4. Disable Telemetry
1. Go to **Privacy & Security** → **Firefox Data Collection and Use**.
2. **Uncheck** all boxes (Technical data, crash reports, etc.).
> **Why?** Prevents "anonymous" usage data from being sent back to Mozilla, reducing your device's unique fingerprint.

### ⚖️ A Note on DuckDuckGo
While we recommend DuckDuckGo over Google, no service is perfect. According to [ToS;DR](https://tosdr.org/en/service/220):
* ⚠️ **Implicit Consent:** They assume you agree to their terms just by using the site.
* ⚠️ **Term Changes:** They may update their privacy policy without emailing you first.
* ✅ **Anonymity:** No registration is required, and they provide a [Tor Onion Service](https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sja7o78xcotqf65c666m6ha6p26766id.onion/) for maximum privacy.

**Alternative:** If you want even more control, try [SearXNG](https://searxng.org/) (a meta-search engine you can self-host).
