# 🚀 Remove Yourself from the Greed – Take Control of Your Privacy! 🔒

> **Break free from surveillance capitalism.** Ditch the data hoarders and reclaim your digital life.

## Meta: The Surveillance Giant 👹
Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Quest) has **doubled down** on surveillance-driven advertising and cross-platform profiling.  
Recent escalations include:  
- 🤖 **AI features** gobbling up your data  
- 💰 **"Pay or OK" subscriptions** – privacy behind a paywall  
- 🔗 **Deeper data linking** across apps  

**Why leave?** Reduces large-scale tracking of your behavior, limiting what one company can infer, store, and **monetize** about your life.

## Snapchat: Not as Innocent as It Seems 📱👻
Snapchat has **significant privacy pitfalls**:  
- 📍 **Heavy location tracking** (Snap Map stalks your every move)  
- 📊 **Extensive metadata collection**  
- 🧠 **AI training** on your snaps and chats  
- ⚖️ **Broad data sharing** with partners & law enforcement  

Especially risky for **teens** and high-risk users. It's no ad-tech behemoth like Meta, but don't mistake it for "safe." **Quit or lock it down hard.**

## Google: The Tracking Empire 🏢📍
Google (Search, Chrome, Maps, YouTube, Gmail, Android) builds **detailed profiles** from your searches, location history, emails, and app usage.  
Key issues:  
- 🌐 **Cross-device tracking** via fingerprinting and cookies  
- 📱 **Location history** that knows your every move  
- 🔍 **Search data** shared with advertisers and now competitors  

**Why de-Google?** One company tracks nearly everything you do online and offline. Switch to alternatives like DuckDuckGo, Firefox, and ProtonMail.

## TikTok: Data Vacuum from China 🇨🇳📱
TikTok collects **everything**: keystrokes, face scans, location, contacts, and viewing habits for hyper-personalized feeds.  
- ⚠️ **Geopolitical risks** (ByteDance under Chinese law)  
- 🕵️ **Staff accessing data** to spy on journalists  
- 📈 **Addictive algorithms** powered by your data  

**Why quit?** Extreme profiling + national security concerns make it a privacy nightmare.

**💡 Pro Tip:**  
Start with data exports → permanent account deletions → switch to privacy-first alternatives:  
- 📱 **Signal** (instead of WhatsApp)  
- 🔍 **DuckDuckGo** (instead of Google Search)  
- 🌐 **Firefox** (instead of Chrome)  
- ✉️ **ProtonMail** (instead of Gmail)  
- 🎵 **NewPipe** (instead of YouTube app)
