# Privacy
Remove yourself from the greed. And take controll over your Privacy.

Meta has doubled down on surveillance-driven advertising and cross-platform profiling, and recent changes (AI features, “Pay or OK” subscriptions, deeper data linking) have intensified long‑standing privacy concerns. Removing yourself from Meta reduces large‑scale tracking of your behavior across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Quest, limiting how much a single company can infer, store, and monetize about your life.
