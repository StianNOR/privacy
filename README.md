# 🚀 Remove Yourself from the Greed – Take Control of Your Privacy! 🔒

> **Break free from surveillance capitalism.** Ditch the data hoarders and reclaim your digital life.

## Meta: The Surveillance Giant 👹
Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Quest) has **doubled down** on surveillance-driven advertising and cross-platform profiling.  
Recent escalations include:  
- 🤖 **AI features** gobbling up your data  
- 💰 **"Pay or OK" subscriptions** – privacy behind a paywall  
- 🔗 **Deeper data linking** across apps  

**Why leave?** Reduces large-scale tracking of your behavior, limiting what one company can infer, store, and **monetize** about your life.

## Snapchat: Not as Innocent as It Seems 📱👻
Snapchat has **significant privacy pitfalls**:  
- 📍 **Heavy location tracking** (Snap Map stalks your every move)  
- 📊 **Extensive metadata collection**  
- 🧠 **AI training** on your snaps and chats  
- ⚖️ **Broad data sharing** with partners & law enforcement  

Especially risky for **teens** and high-risk users. It's no ad-tech behemoth like Meta, but don't mistake it for "safe." **Quit or lock it down hard.**
