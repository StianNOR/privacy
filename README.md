* 🔗 **Cross-App Linking:** Tracking your behavior even when you aren't using their apps.

### Google (Search, Chrome, Gmail, Android)
Google builds "digital twins" of its users by tracking every search, location, and email.
* 🌐 **Fingerprinting:** Advanced methods to track you even without cookies.
* 📍 **Location History:** A permanent record of your physical movements.

### TikTok & Snapchat
* 📱 **TikTok:** Collects biometric data, keystroke patterns, and clipboard content.
