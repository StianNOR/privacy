# Privacy
Remove yourself from the greed. And take controll over your Privacy.

Meta has doubled down on surveillance-driven advertising and cross-platform profiling, and recent changes (AI features, “Pay or OK” subscriptions, deeper data linking) have intensified long‑standing privacy concerns. Removing yourself from Meta reduces large‑scale tracking of your behavior across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Quest, limiting how much a single company can infer, store, and monetize about your life.

Snapchat also has significant privacy issues: heavy location tracking, extensive metadata collection, AI training on your content, and broad data sharing with partners and law enforcement, especially risky for teens and high‑risk users. It is less of a pure ad‑tech behemoth than Meta, but if you care about minimizing behavioral and location profiling, treating Snapchat as “safe” is a mistake and quitting or hard‑locking it down is worth considering.​
