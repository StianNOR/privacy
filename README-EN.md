## 👹 The Surveillance Giants

### Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp)
Meta has doubled down on surveillance-driven advertising and cross-platform profiling.
* 🤖 **AI Training:** Your posts and photos are used to train proprietary models.
* 💰 **"Pay or OK":** Putting a price tag on fundamental privacy rights.
* 🔗 **Cross-App Linking:** Tracking your behavior even when you aren't using their apps.

### Google (Search, Chrome, Gmail, Android)
Google builds "digital twins" of its users by tracking every search, location, and email.
* 🌐 **Fingerprinting:** Advanced methods to track you even without cookies.
* 📍 **Location History:** A permanent record of your physical movements.

### TikTok & Snapchat
* 📱 **TikTok:** Collects biometric data, keystroke patterns, and clipboard content.
* 👻 **Snapchat:** Constant GPS tracking via Snap Map and extensive metadata collection.

* **Meta:** Go to **Accounts Center** → **Your information and permissions** → **Download your information**.
* **Instagram:** In Settings, search for **"Download your information"** to get a copy of all your photos and messages.

## 🔧 Hardening Firefox (Quick Setup)
*Stop the leaks by adjusting these built-in settings. Open Firefox and go to **Settings**:*

### 🛡️ 1. Set Tracking Protection to "Strict"
1. Navigate to **Privacy & Security**.
2. Under **Enhanced Tracking Protection**, select **Strict**.
> **Why?** This blocks social media trackers, fingerprinters, and cross-site cookies more aggressively than the default mode.

### 🔒 2. Enable HTTPS-Only Mode
1. Stay in **Privacy & Security** and scroll down to **Security**.
2. Select **Enable HTTPS-Only Mode in all windows**.
> **Why?** This ensures your connection is always encrypted. Firefox will warn you before connecting to an insecure (HTTP) site.

### 🔍 3. Switch to DuckDuckGo
1. Go to **Search** in the left sidebar.
2. Under **Default Search Engine**, select **DuckDuckGo**.
3. **Pro Tip:** Uncheck *"Show search suggestions"* to stop your keystrokes from being sent to the server in real-time.

### 🚫 4. Disable Telemetry
1. Go to **Privacy & Security** → **Firefox Data Collection and Use**.
2. **Uncheck** all boxes (Technical data, crash reports, etc.).
> **Why?** Prevents "anonymous" usage data from being sent back to Mozilla, reducing your device's unique fingerprint.

### ⚖️ A Note on Search Engines
**DuckDuckGo** is the best balance of privacy and ease-of-use. However, note that:
* ⚠️ **Implicit Consent:** They assume you agree to terms by using the site.
* ✅ **Anonymity:** No registration required and [Onion Service](https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sja7o78xcotqf65c666m6ha6p26766id.onion/) available.

### 🌀 How to use SearXNG in Firefox
If you prefer [SearXNG](https://searxng.org/) over DuckDuckGo:
1. Visit a public instance like [searxng.site](https://searxng.site).
2. Right-click the address bar and select **"Add Search Engine"**.
3. Go to Firefox **Settings** → **Search** and set it as your **Default Search Engine**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Strict Usage Only:** This is an advanced tool for users seeking maximum anonymity. Because it relies on volunteer-run "instances," it can be slower or occasionally go offline. For most users, DuckDuckGo provides the best balance of privacy and reliability.

**Why use it?** SearXNG aggregates results from 70+ search engines (Google, Bing, etc.) without logging your IP address or search history.

## 📱 Mobile Privacy Wins
* **Delete Unused Apps:** If you haven't used it in a month, delete it. Every app is a potential tracker.
* **Review Permissions:** Revoke "Always On" Location and Microphone access for apps that don't need it.
* **Use a Password Manager:** Stop reusing passwords. Switch to [**Bitwarden**](https://bitwarden.com/) (Open Source) to generate and store unique, encrypted passwords.

## 🕳️ Down the Rabbit Hole: Your Operating System
If you want to truly own your hardware, you must address the "brain" of your computer. Your OS is the ultimate gatekeeper of your data.

### 🚩 Why Leave Windows?
In 2025, Windows has evolved from a tool into "Service-Oriented Spyware." 
* 📸 **Recall & AI:** Microsoft has introduced features that take periodic screenshots of your desktop to make your life "searchable"—creating a massive security risk.
* 📡 **Forced Telemetry:** Windows sends gigabytes of data back to servers, including app usage, search queries, and hardware IDs.
* 🔓 **No Local Control:** It is becoming increasingly difficult to use Windows without a mandatory Microsoft Cloud account.

### 🐧 Option A: The Linux Path (Highly Recommended)
Linux is open-source, meaning the code is public and audited by the community. It contains no hidden backdoors.

### 🛠️ Option B: Hardening Windows (If you can't leave yet)
If you must stay on Windows for gaming or specialized software, don't use the "Stock" version.
* [**AtlasOS**](https://atlasos.net/): An open-source project that strips Windows of its tracking, bloatware, and telemetry.
* [**Privacy.sexy**](https://privacy.sexy/): A web tool that generates scripts to disable hundreds of Windows tracking features in one click.

### 🍎 What about macOS?
macOS is a middle ground. While Apple’s business model is not based on selling your data, it remains a "walled garden."
* **The Good:** Better "App Tracking Transparency" than Windows.
* **The Bad:** It is closed-source. You must trust Apple's word that they aren't scanning your local files.
* **The Verdict:** Better than Windows, but not as private as a well-configured Linux system.
